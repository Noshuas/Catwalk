# Project Catwalk

Hack Reactor front end capstone. We are tasked with updating an old ecommerce front end to modern techonologies.
As a group we created three main components which were the Overview, Questions & Answers, Ratings & Reviews.
Utilizing React with React hooks accelarated development time and enriched the e-commerce browsing experience.

### Overview
Provides a quick insight on the product. Showing the different styles available, prices, and the images of the product displayed. The Overview displays the hero image front and center. With it having an expanded view to zoom in on the details of the product. Navigating to the styles will show the variances of the product, with images, sizes and product availability.


### Questions and Answers
The Questions and Answers widget deals with all incoming questions and answers for the specified product on the page. From here a user can see posted questions, post their own questions, mark them as helpful or report them. On render the page will initially load four questions, any more questions after that, the user is given the option to load more. Within the questions card, a user can see various answer responses to the question. A user can add their own answers to the specific question by accessing the add answer modal and within the modal a user can upload up to 5 photos.

### Ratings and Reviews
The ratings and reviews widget breaks down rating and review information about the given product, all of which information is provided by users of the site. On page load, the widget will request information from the api to dynamically render the correct information on the DOM. Such information includes:
 - **overall product rating**, represented as a float rounded to the nearest tenth and as a series of stars rounded to the nearest quarter of a complete star.
 - **the number of people who recommend this product**, represented as a percentage out of 100.
 - **a breakdown of rating distributions**, where the labels for each rating value (from 1 to 5) are buttons that toggle filters on the review list
 - **a breakdown of ratings for individual characteristics** such as fit, comfort, build quality, etc.
 - **individual ratings and reviews**, which can by filtered and sorted.

Additionally, users can also submit their own ratings and reviews pertaining to all the aformentioned content through the modal.
